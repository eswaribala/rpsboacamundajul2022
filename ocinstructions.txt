Hi Team,

 

I have installed RedHat OpenShift v4.10.20 (latest version) on all the 3 servers.

 

RedHat OpenShift access details can be found in a file named openshift.txt kept in the user's home directory on the CentOS servers. The passwords for OpenShift are different on server1, server2 and server3.

 

When accessing RedHat web console, Google chrome web browser should be used, hence I have installed chrome browser on all 3 servers.

 

In case PersistenVolume is required for the training, I have installed NFS server on all 3 servers and exported folders for every user and trainer on all 3 servers.

 

The exported folder can be found by the CentOS root user with the below command

showmount -e localhost

 

How to test if RedHat Openshift is working?

Login as user01-user08 on OS01 (Server 1 - 192.168.51.236) with rps@2345 as password

Login as user09-user17 on os02  (Server 2 - 192.168.21.123) with rps@2345 as password

Login as user18-user25 on OS03 (Server 3 - 192.168.52.118) with rps@2345 as password

 

Command Line Test

oc get nodes

 

What is the RedHat OpenShift web console URL?

Login as user01-user08 on OS01 (Server 1 - 192.168.51.236) with rps@2345 as password

From the terminal, type

cat ~/openshift.txt

 

Web browser test (Google Chrome - From CentOS)

Copy/Paste URL from ~/openshift.txt file kept in the respective centos user's home directory.

 

The OpenShift web console gives warnings, hence click on Advanced on Proceed, this must be done twice and moving forward it won't prompt such security warnings for OpenShift web console.

 

For Trainer

Trainer can use root user with rps@2345 login credentials on CentOS.

 

OpenShift - Web Access (From CentOS)

Google Chrome browser can't be launched as root user, hence from terminal the trainer can launch google chrome as 

google-chrome --no-sandbox &

 

CLI Access(As Administrator)

oc get nodes
